#Instructions

#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

#The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# BMI = weight(kg) / height^2(m^2)

#Hint

    #1. Check the data type of the inputs.
    #2. Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
    #3. Remember PEMDAS.
    #4. Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).


# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

height_2 = float(height)
weight_2 = float(weight)

result = (weight_2 / height_2 ** 2)

print(int(result))

# Course Solution

weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)

# Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# or using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)

print(bmi_as_int)
